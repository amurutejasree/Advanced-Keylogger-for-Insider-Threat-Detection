# 🔐 Advanced Keylogger for Insider Threat Detection


The **Advanced Keylogger for Insider Threat Detection** is a lightweight, stealthy, and modular keylogging system developed to help cybersecurity professionals and researchers understand internal risks, monitor system integrity, and detect signs of insider threats in enterprise environments.

This tool supports:

* Real-time keystroke logging
* Contextual data capture (active window, timestamps)
* Encrypted log storage and secure transmission
* Alert mechanisms for suspicious behaviors
* Integration with SIEM systems

## 🎯 Use Cases

* **Security research** into insider threats
* **Simulated red team engagements**
* **Behavioral analytics** in enterprise environments (with consent)
* **Security audits and monitoring** for critical systems

## ⚙️ Features

* 🕵️ Stealth Mode: Runs invisibly in the background
* 🔐 Encrypted Logging: AES encryption of keystroke data
* 📅 Contextual Logging: Records timestamps and active window titles
* ⚡ Lightweight: Minimal system footprint
* 📬 Optional: Email or remote server exfiltration (for permitted use only)
* 🔄 Modular Design: Easily extensible for additional event monitoring

## 🚧 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Admin/root access (for installation and stealth features)
* Optional: SMTP server or remote logging endpoint

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/advanced-keylogger-insider-threat.git
cd advanced-keylogger-insider-threat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## 🔍 Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to adjust parameters such as:

```yaml
logging_interval: 60
encryption_key: "your-secret-key"
exfiltration:
  method: "email"
  email:
    smtp_server: "smtp.example.com"
    port: 587
    username: "user@example.com"
    password: "yourpassword"
    recipient: "security@example.com"
```

> **Note**: Never hard-code passwords in production environments. Use environment variables or secret management systems.
